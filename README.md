## Description
This is a beautifully styled and responsive e-commerce platform designed for an artist who sells prints of her digital paintings. The website offers a variety of print sizes, materials, and prices. To manage this diversity, the database was carefully structured to accommodate different product variants, including size, material, stock count, prices, names, descriptions, images of the digital paintings, and visualization images for each material.

To ensure a clean and user-friendly interface, Product Variants were created, allowing users to easily select the size or material they prefer while dynamically updating the price and images.

For each product, there is an illustration page featuring the main image, various product variants, and a description of the illustrated creature. The shop page enables users to filter products by category, while the illustrations page provides filtering options for illustrations by category.
